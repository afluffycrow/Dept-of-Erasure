Weeks have passed since any clear instructions came though. We can hear mortars and enemy air support in the <lwest>, but so far we have not been pushed back. No one expects any other outcome of course, it has been <tdays since resupply> and most of us <chave no ammo left> from firing off at every sound on the dark front. When the enemy do attack, we will have to run or throw rocks.
