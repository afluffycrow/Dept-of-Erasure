The liberation was a wonderful success, they didn’t see us coming!

Now on to the next stage of combat. <llocation> is filled with our rebels, I know that the people will support us as well as troops coming up from the capitol. 

I’m chewing the last of your buntcake as I write this, sorry about the crumbs. I can almost imagine being back at home, I’ll be with you soon.
Don’t forget me,
Maria
