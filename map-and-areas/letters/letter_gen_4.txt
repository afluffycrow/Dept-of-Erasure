To Ahmose,
Tomorrow, we leave for the <llocation >, 
there will be <cconflict> there <tbefore
the week is out>. I’m <mscared> but I know
that you’re thinking of me, and I’m doing 
what’s right for our country.
Don’t <mworry> about me, all of our fighters
band together even in the <mhardest of times>.
Give my love to Kai and the others. 
I’ll send another letter once the fight is done.
If you can, send me some of your seeded bread,
our ration packs are very <mboring>!
From Lake
