Rob, I wish I could see you.
Still camped over in <llocation>. 
I hope my message gets through, <mblasted supply
lines>! We heard there are <cnew divisions> 
coming to support us. <tOnce they arrive> and we 
are finally <cresupplied>, we will be able to 
<cmake a push> against the enemy and recapture 
<mall we lost from our recent inactivity and 
failure>. All my heart to you and everyone in the
<lcapitol>. We will not let these invaders even 
near our great cities. We will push them back!
Love to you and the kids,
Arian
