<cWe lost the fight>, Maitland.
We fought until we had nothing left, but they had more men, more weapons. <cWe had no choice but to retreat.>

Now, <cwe regroup>. Some of us made it to the
<lhills outside the city>, but we’re scattered. <llocation> is still holding, and if we can reach them, we’ll have a chance to fight again.

I dropped my pack with the last of your coffee when we were running. The smell lingered on my hands, just for a moment, like home. <mI'm so lost and desperate.> I’ll find my way back to you.
With love,
Lim
