My darling,
The city is ours! The enemy fled before they even had time to fight. Time to prepare for the next push. <llocation> is already seeing our banners raised, and our allies from the <lsouth> will be joining us <ttomorrow>.
I found a scrap of your scarf in my pack today. It smells like home, Iâ€™ll be back before you know it.
Think of me,
Luca
