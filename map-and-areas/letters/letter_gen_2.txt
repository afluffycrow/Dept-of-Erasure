Sunan,
Still no news from you. I guess our letters do 
not get through, or yours donâ€™t. No surprise, 
<cour aircrafts fall out of the sky> faster 
than we can fuel them. <mSupplies are low and 
we have been so hungry>. <tYesterday> a supply 
drop landed near so we sent a squad to get it.
The boys were so happy. If only had pepper and
coffee. Honestly, those in charge do not even
know how <mbad> it is here.
Sending my love,
Aaren
