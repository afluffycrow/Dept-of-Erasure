Oh Bhrum,
I can’t describe the <mhorrors> I saw in battle. 
They knew we were coming. It was like <cbeing 
pushed into a meat grinder>. 
<mDark times for us all.> 
I wish this war would end, but they won’t stop 
pressing us. They seem soulless to me. <cI took a
 bullet to the shoulder>, my god <mdoes it hurt>. 
Get yourselves to the <least>, as far from this 
<mgodforsaken> <cbloodbaths> as possible.
Wishing I was home,
Strand
