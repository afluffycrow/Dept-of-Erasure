Winslow,rejoice with me!
We've been <crushing from place to place>,
defeating enemies left and right.
Will I even recieve your reply, 
or will be on to <llocation> in a hearbeat?
We are <talready> <con the march>, 
they won't expect a strike from the <lold roads>.
From the great and powerful Shalev!
